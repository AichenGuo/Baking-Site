<section class="steps">
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Separate yolk and egg whites into two different containers. Keep egg whites chill for later use.</li>
	<li>Pour the prepared milk, sugar, and corn oil into a clean container. Use hand whisk to mix them well. You can put in a few drops of vanillin if you wish.</li>
	<li>Sieve cake flour into the last container. Use baking spatula to mix them together in a "Z" way.</li>
	<li>Add yolk into the mix, and use hand whisk to mix them well in a "Z" way.</li>
	<li>Use spatula to make sure the yolk mix does not contain any flour chunks.</li>
	<li>Take out the egg whites, and add in a few drops of lemonade. Add in sugar in three times while using electric whisk to beat up egg whites until you can pull out an upright egg white tip.</li>
	<li>Pour in 1/3 egg whites mix into the yolk mix, and use spatula to mix them well in irrugular directions.</li>
	<li>Pour the mix back to the rest of egg whites mix and use spatula to mix them well.</li>
	<li>Preheat the oven to 305 &#8457;. Without putting in oil papers inside the cake mold, pour the mix into the mold from a height of 15cm. Gently shake the mold to remove bubbles.</li>
	<li>Once preheat is completed, put the cake mold into the middle lower layer of the oven to bake for 55 minutes.
		<ul>
			<li>During the baking process, the batter will grow taller and may burst, which does not matter.</li>
			<li>You may use a stick to test if the cake is done. If the stick does not take any blatter out, then the cake is well-baked. </li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Take out the cake mold from the oven once it is done. Drop it from a height of 15cm twice to allow the heat go out. Flip it down to let it cool down.</li>
	<li>After two hours of cooling down, use hand to carefully press the edge of the cake to remove it from the mold and take the cake out.</li>
	<li>Cut a hole from the bottom of the cake to fill in cream lava later (save the cut out piece).</li>
	<li>To make cream lava, put heavy whipping cream, sugar, milk, and a little bit of salt into a bowl, and use electric whisk to beat them until the fluid reaches a yogurt texture.</li>
	<li>Pour a little cream lava into the hole of the cake, and put the cut out piece back.</li>
	<li>Flip the cake and pour the rest of lava on the cake's surface.</li>
	<li>Scatter some pork sung on the top. You can also substitute pork sung with other things you like, e.g. Oreos, fruits, boba, etc.</li>
	<li>Enjoy!</li>
