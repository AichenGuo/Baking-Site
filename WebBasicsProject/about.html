	<summary>My Childhood</summary>
	<p>I grew up in Beijing, China. After graduating from UC Berkeley for my undergraduate degree, I now live in San Francisco. With passion in design, I decided to major in Information Experience Design at Pratt Institute for a master degree. And I plan to live in New York for a while once the pandemic is over. Feel free to visit <a id="portfolio" href="https://www.aichenguo.com/">my online portfolio website</a> to know more about me.</p>

	<summary>My Baking Journey</summary>
	<p>Similar to many people, I started to experiment on food during the quarantine in 2020. I had my first cake baked in August when my friend had her 22 birthday. And then my baking journey began.<br>
		Having tried over 10 baking recipes in the past two months, I decide to find a way to note down the recipes I've used and modified, starting with a few of my favorites. I wish to use this website as a form of documentation for myself, and hopefully, it can also help others in their baking journey.
