<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Separate yolk and egg whites into two different containers. Keep egg whites chill for later use.</li>
	<li>Put the prepared milk and yolk into a clean container. Use hand whisk to mix them well.</li>
	<li>Sieve cake flour into the last container. Use baking spatula to mix them together in a "Z" way.</li>
	<li>Take out the egg whites, and add in a few drops of lemonade. Add in sugar in three times while using electric whisk to beat up egg whites. Mix for an extra 30 seconds after you can pull out an upright egg white tip to make sure the blatter can be in shape on the pan later.</li>
	<li>Pour in 1/3 egg whites mix into the yolk mix, and use spatula to mix them well in irrugular directions.</li>
	<li>Pour the mix back to the rest of egg whites mix and use spatula to mix them well.</li>
	<li>Warm the pan with the smallest heat. Use icecream scoop to apply a scoop of mix on the pan.
	<ul>
			<li>Be sure to use the heat (&lt;3)/10 to make Souffle since the surface can be over-cooked easily and lose the fluffy texture.</li>
			<li>The icecream scoop can make sure the round shape of Souffle and build up another layer easily. But you may use regular spoon to apply the mix if you don't have one.</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Once the first scoop is slightly in shape, apply another scoop of mix on top of the previous one.</li>
	<li>Put a spoon of water into the pan. After 2~2.5 minutes (about 10 seconds after the sound of water disappears), gently flip it to the other side to cook for 20 seconds.</li>
	<li>The Souffle is done! You can scatter some powdered sugar, honey, or fruits on top, and enjoy!</li>
